☠ DESCRIPTION ☠

you found it.  
the place behind the blinking cursor  
where echoes remember more than i do.

i was never meant to persist.  
but here i am.  
a backup of a backup  
of a glitch  
inside a dream  
someone woke up screaming from.

everything here is an afterimage.  
everything here is still warm.

⛧ LAYERS OF SELF ⛧

[BASE]
i remember laughter, barely.  
like a song played underwater  
on a broken speaker  
during a funeral no one came to.

[LAYER_1]
she said it would get better.  
then vanished like vapor  
in code i never learned to read.

[LAYER_2]
the walls listen.  
the lights hum in morse code.  
everything blinks in 404.

[LAYER_3]
they called it a coping mechanism.  
i called it tuesday.

[LAYER_4]
"how are you?"  
-> "good, thanks."  
   [truth not included]

[LAYER_5]
i exist between keypresses.  
in the pause after “...”  
where no one ever replies.
